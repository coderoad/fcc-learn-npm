      "content": "When starting a new project, NPM generates a package.json file. This file lists the package dependencies for your project. Since NPM packages are regularly updated, the package.json file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.\n\nNPM saves packages in a folder named node_modules. These packages can be installed in two ways:\n\n- globally in a root node_modules folder, accessible by all projects.\n- locally within a project's own node_modules folder, accessible only to that project.\n\nMost developers prefer to install packages local to each project to create a separation between the dependencies of different projects.\n\nThe `package.json` file is the center of any Node.js project or NPM package. It stores information about your project, similar to how the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML document describes the content of a webpage. It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. There are only two required fields; \"name\" and \"version\", but it’s good practice to provide additional information about your project that could be useful to future users or maintainers.\nIf you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the package.json file on the top level of the tree.

One day, your understanding of these numbers will save you from accidentally introducing breaking changes to your project without understanding why things that worked yesterday suddenly don’t work today. This is how Semantic Versioning works according to the official website:\n\n```json\n\"package\": \"MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\"\n```\n\nThe MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes.\n\nThe MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.\n\nThe PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.\nThis means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that won’t work with earlier versions.\n\nUsing the NPM cli, a specific version of a package can be installed by specifying the `@` version.\n\n```shell\nnpm install express@4.17.0\n```",
